# Agricultural Productivity in Ghana

*Collaborations with enthusiastic and committed graduate students are welcomed. For more details see the wiki on [Graduate Student Opportunity to Lead Research on Agricultural Productivity in Ghana](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/wiki/Graduate-Student-Opportunity-to-Lead-Research-on-Agricultural-Productivity-in-Ghana)*

## 📘 Overview
The primary objective of this project is to determine whether agricultural production shortfalls in Ghana are driven by farmer technical inefficiency, technology gaps, or a combination of both.

It compiles a series of research articles that assess farmer-specific and institutional factors, exploring how they influence technical inefficiency and the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies.

By identifying the root causes of production shortfalls, this project provides empirical evidence crucial for policy discussions aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity in contexts with limited access to new technologies.

## 📊 Data
The project utilizes farm-level data from the Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS), which are population-based surveys conducted periodically, approximately every five years, in Ghana: [GLSS1](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/7),  [GLSS2](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/4), [GLSS3](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/12), [GLSS4](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/14), [GLSS5](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/5), [GLSS6](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/72), and [GLSS7](https://microdata.statsghana.gov.gh/index.php/catalog/97)

## 🧪 Methods
- The Meta-Stochastic Frontier (MSF) model, as introduced by [Huang, Huang, & Liu (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11123-014-0402-2), is employed to capture technological heterogeneity and technical inefficiencies across farmers.
- To minimize self-selection bias and to reduce model dependency, a matching approach is also utilized where applicable ([Abadie and Imbens 2006](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00655.x); [Abadie and Imbens 2016](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA11293)).
