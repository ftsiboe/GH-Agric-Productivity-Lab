# Agricultural Productivity in Ghana: Replications

## Overview

For details about the project and its broader context, please refer to the main [GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab README](../README.md) in the repository's root.

See the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file in the repository's root for details.

This directory contains the replication code and related files for the agricultural productivity project in Ghana. The objective is to provide a transparent and reproducible analysis framework that validates and extends the findings presented in published research.

Note that the [legacy studies](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/tree/master/replications/legacy_studies) were conducted before the project fully transitioned to GitHub. As such, their content is not based on the current resources available in this repository. Nonetheless, legacy files are provided in the individual study folders to replicate, as closely as possible, the initial studies.

## Structure

Each folder contains scripts, data, and results specific to the study indicated by its name. The individual studies include:

- **`tech_inefficiency_conflict`**: Examines how conflict and social cohesion affect farm production.
- **`tech_inefficiency_disability`**: Investigates the impact of disabilities on farm production.
- **`tech_inefficiency_education`**: Analyzes how education influences farm production.
- **`tech_inefficiency_extension`**: Evaluates the effect of extension services on farm production.
- **`tech_inefficiency_land_tenure`**: Assesses how land tenure security influences farm production.
- **`tech_inefficiency_nonfarm_enterprise`**: Explores how nonfarm enterprise affects farm production.
- **`tech_inefficiency_resource_extract`**: Investigates the impact of resource extraction activities on farm production.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. For suggestions, improvements, or to report any issues with the replication code, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions help improve the reproducibility and robustness of the research.

Collaborations with enthusiastic and committed graduate students are welcomed.
