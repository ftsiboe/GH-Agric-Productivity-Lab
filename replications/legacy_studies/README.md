### [Nationally Representative Farm/Household Level Dataset on Crop Production in Ghana from 1987-2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4134518 ) | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/30%20Years%20of%20Crop%20Production%20in%20Ghana.zip)
Reliable and comprehensive national agricultural statistics is crucial not only for agricultural development but general economic transformation. While data collected via the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) provides Ghana with this avenue, the reports from this data generated by the Ghana Statistical Service neither consider the trends nor in-depth analysis of agricultural statistics. This paper sets the premise to fill this knowledge gap by harmonizing and generating a nationally representative micro level dataset from all previous LSMSs. The harmonized data has the widest geographic and seasonal coverage of farmers in Ghana. As such it presents a unique opportunity to empirically analyze key agricultural phenomena at the household if not at the farmer level. 

### [Technology and managerial performance of farm operators by age in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11123-023-00679-y)  | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2023%20Technology%20and%20managerial%20performance%20of%20farm%20operators%20by%20age%20in%20Ghana.zip)
Farm-level decision-making by resource-constrained smallholder farmers, such as investment in improved farm management practices and technologies may considerably be influenced by the age of farm operators. However, evidence of the effect of farm operators‚Äô age on farm efficiency and technological endowment, and consequently on agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa has been inexact. To contribute to an improved understanding of the age-efficiency-productivity nexus, this study investigates the impacts of farm operators‚Äô age on agricultural productivity by evaluating the managerial performance and technological endowment of the operators, disaggregated across three age cohorts, viz. the youth, middle-aged and the aged. We fit the meta-stochastic frontier statistical framework to a country-wide sample of 24,596 farm households, spanning three decades of data collection in Ghana. The results show that relative to the potentials of each age cohort, more output can be generated using currently allocated inputs, but under improved farm management practices. Whereas we did not find evidence for possible age-related technological differences in agricultural production in Ghana, we did find strong support for possible age-induced managerial differences in farm production, with youth operators being more efficient than their middle-aged and aged peers. Consequently, the age of farm operators significantly affects agricultural productivity in Ghana through their efficiency of resource allocation. We find these results relevant for policy attention, in terms of the targeting of support to farm operators in the various age cohorts and in the country‚Äôs quest to achieve greater agricultural productivity. 

### [Taking Stock of Gender Gaps in Crop Production Technology Adoption and Technical Efficiency in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2022.2150664) | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2023%20Taking%20stock%20of%20gender%20gaps%20in%20crop%20production%20in%20Ghana.zip)
This paper examines gender disparities in agricultural production by applying a stylized translog meta-stochastic frontier model to data pooled from nine cross-sectional surveys spanning approximately three decades (1986‚Äì2017) and covering 12 crops in Ghana. The study finds that female farmers have technology gap and technical efficiency scores of 23% and 77%, respectively, compared to 18% and 73% for male farmers. Although the technical efficiency gap of 4% in favor of male farmers has remained steady, the technology adoption gap for females has significantly reduced over time. Overall, female farmers operate at 59% of the potential available through Ghana's crop production technology, compared to 61% for their male counterparts. These findings are critical for shaping policies to reduce gender disparities in agriculture. 

### [Starchy Staples Production Shortfall in Ghana: Influence of Technical Inefficiency Versus Ecological Technology Gaps](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284780) | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2023%20Starchy%20staples%20production%20shortfalls%20in%20Ghana.zip)
Starchy staples are essential for the livelihoods of many in Ghana, yet their productivity remains low. This study uses a unique dataset and meta-frontier efficiency analysis to determine whether production shortfalls in cassava, yam, cocoyam, and plantain are due to technical inefficiency or technology gaps. Results reveal a production shortfall of about 50% for these crops, with approximately 45% attributed to farmer technical inefficiencies and 20% to technology gaps. The findings suggest that enhancing farmer managerial skills could significantly improve output in the starchy staples sector. 

### [Production Technology, Efficiency, and Productivity of Cereal Farms: Prospects for Enhancing Farm Performance in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2022.16)  |  [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2022%20Production%20technology%20efficiency%20and%20productivity%20of%20cereal%20farms%20in%20Ghana.zip)
This paper examines the production technology and performance of Ghana's cereal farms using a nationally representative dataset from 26,449 farms and a meta-stochastic frontier approach. The study finds that key inputs such as land and seed have the highest impact on cereal output across various agro-ecological zones. Despite this, significant technical inefficiencies exist across all zones, indicating room for improvement in farm management practices. The research highlights variations in technology adoption and management practices as pivotal for boosting cereal productivity. 

### [Chronic Sources of Low Cocoa Production in Ghana: New Insights from Meta-Analysis of Old Survey Data](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2021.3) | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2021%20Chronic%20Sources%20of%20Low%20Cocoa%20Production%20in%20Ghana.zip)
Analyzing 30 years of production data from a nationally representative household sample, this study investigates chronic factors behind low cocoa production in Ghana. The analysis indicates that farmer technical inefficiency exceeds the regional technology gap by 8 percentage points and consistently hampers overall performance. The findings imply that enhancing managerial skills among cocoa farmers could lead to significant increases in output.

### [Effect of Fertilizer Subsidy on Household Level Cereal Production in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2021.e00916) | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2021%20Effect%20of%20fertilizer%20subsidy%20on%20household%20level%20cereal%20production%20in%20Ghana.zip)
This study evaluates Ghana's nationwide Fertilizer Subsidy Program (GFSP), launched in 2008, and its impact on cereal yields. Using matching methods on cross-sectional data from 5,923 cereal-growing households collected in 2012/13 and 2016/17, the analysis finds that the program increased cereal yields by 24.5%, with maize farmers showing the most benefit. The results support the GFSP's effectiveness in enhancing agricultural productivity. 

### [Spatiotemporal Evaluation of Dry Beans and Groundnut Production Technology and Inefficiency in Ghana](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/310316/?ln=en&v=pdf)  |  [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2021%20Dry%20Beans%20and%20Groundnut%20Production%20Technology%20and%20Inefficiency%20in%20Ghana.zip)
This paper investigates the changes in production efficiency and technology adoption for dry beans and groundnuts over 15 production seasons in Ghana. Drawing on a nationally representative dataset of 10,518 farmers, the study uses a meta-stochastic frontier approach to reveal that while technology gaps have reduced over time, technical inefficiencies remain a major limiting factor. Key determinants for these trends include farmer education, mechanization, access to extension services, and land ownership. 

### [Vegetable Production Technical Efficiency and Technology Gaps in Ghana](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/301046/?ln=en&v=pdf) | [üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GH-Agric-Productivity-Lab/blob/master/replications/legacy_studies/2019%20Vegetable%20Production%20Technical%20Efficiency%20and%20Technology%20Gaps%20in%20Ghana.zip)
This study assesses the shortfall in vegetable production in Ghana by analyzing data from okra, pepper, and tomato farmers using a meta-stochastic frontier approach. It identifies that the ranking of production inputs is: land, hired labor, fertilizer, pesticide, and family labor. The study finds that vegetable production is characterized by diseconomies of scale, with technical efficiency estimates of 54% for okra, 74% for pepper, and 58% for tomato. Additionally, technology gaps vary, being severe for okra, modest for tomato, and nearly non-existent for pepper, suggesting tailored strategies for each crop.
