## Abstract
Generally, education is seen as the most critical form of human capital. This makes an improved understanding of its impact on agricultural productivity and farm efficiency in Ghana very crucial. Exploiting a nation-wide cross-sectional data of 19,862 farm families across Ghana, the stochastic metafrontier function along with matching techniques were used in analyzing the data. The choice of the metafrontier function is anchored on the premise that it considers variations in the production settings and characteristics of farm operators with diverse forms, types, and levels of educational attainment. The empirical analysis reveals that attaining some form, type, and level of education does not necessarily translate into technological advantage for farm households in Ghana. Moreover, the impact of education on farming efficiency is somewhat heterogenous, albeit, generally in favor of uneducated households. These findings suggest that educational attainment does not essentially translate into meaningful productivity gains for farm households in Ghana. The underlying drivers and implications of these results are discussed.
