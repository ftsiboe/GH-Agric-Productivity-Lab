## Concept note
This research explores how extracting natural resources—like oil, minerals, and precious metals—influences agriculture in Ghana. While natural resources bring significant money to countries, supporting things like building roads, schools, and hospitals, they can also cause problems such as environmental damage, soil pollution, and loss of farmland, negatively impacting agriculture.

Agriculture is crucial for African economies, employing nearly half of the continent’s workers and significantly contributing to national income, food security, and rural livelihoods. Improvements in agriculture also help protect the environment, combat climate change, and reduce rural poverty.

In Ghana, the discovery of oil and mining activities (especially gold mining) has boosted economic growth, but it has also posed challenges for agriculture. This study specifically investigates how being close to resource extraction sites affects farmers' productivity and their farming techniques. It examines these effects over many years and across various regions and farming communities.

Using advanced statistical methods, the research compares farmers near resource extraction activities with those further away to measure differences in farming efficiency and technology use. The study aims to provide clear evidence on how natural resource extraction impacts agriculture in Ghana, informing better policies that support sustainable economic growth without harming agricultural production.
